# studentEasy
This App allows every Unibo student, for each faculty, to visualize easily and fast all the lectures in the month in a calendar view. 
Furthemore, everyday, the student can set an alarm for the following day. The time will be decided by the App in according to the tomorrow's lecture schedule.
Another action permitted is to connect with the virtual room instantanely, just with the press of a botton, if a lecture is going on.
